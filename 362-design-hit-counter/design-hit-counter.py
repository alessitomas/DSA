1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 300 -> 300 -> 301

I could create a total count per second, array.

For every hit I would increment the count from it timestamp and also the next 299.
hit would be cosntant O(1)

Get hits would be constant just the need to acess hte index value.

bottleneck and problem 1 <= timestamp <= 2 * 10Ë†9, at most 2 billion bit space occupied.




Queue that only stores hits in the last 300 seconds?


new hit 

have a global value with the total cumulative sum

IF equals last registered add its count
Else add a new time recording with count 1
pop any starting node that has a timestamp <= X - 300


O(1), since the queue will have at most 300 nodes

get hits:


O(1), get it from global variable


["hit","getHits"]

[[301],[301]]

return 4
return 5
T = 6
