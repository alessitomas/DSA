class Solution:
    # n candies
    # limit per child
    # 3 children
    

    # Arranjo.  
    # All combinations where the order matters, but needs to sum to n, and limit per child
    # 
    # 
    # Solution, backtracking to create all possibilities
    # branches give to child 1 or give to child 2 or give to child 3
    #
    # time complexity: 3Ë†N
    # space complexity: N


    # prunning to avoid getting the same final state more than once
    # once you give to child i you can give it more to child i-1
